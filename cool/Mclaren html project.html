        <h2>
            History of the team
        </h2>

        
        <p>
            McLaren is one of the oldest active teams in Formula 1, and has been in competition every year since 1966. The team was formed by New Zealand racer Bruce McLaren, who sadly lost his life 
            while testing one of the Can-Am cars which bore his name at Goodwood in 1970. Four years later the team won its first world championship with Emerson Fittipaldi, and a second came
            in 1976 courtesy of James Hunt. Iconic driver Ayrton Senna (shown on the right in the Monaco Grand Prix) won 3 championships during the 1980s and 90s, meaning he was to be 
            recognised as one of the greatest drivers to ever compete in the sport. More recently, Lewis Hamilton won 21 races (over 6 seasons) and his first world championship with the team in
            2008 before going on to win 6 more with Mercedes-AMG between 2014 and 2020. He is now undoubtedly the greatest driver of all time.

            McLaren have been in poor form over the last decade in comparison to their history, only winning one race since 2013. Bad engine choices and financial issues have
            meant that the constructors have struggled to create a car competitive enough for race wins and podiums. In 2022, brit Lando Norris and australian Daniel Ricciardo are driving 
            for the McLaren Team in the MCL36 (shown left). This year has unfortunately been a highly unsuccessful campaign as new regulations for 2022 have not positively 
            affected the team.

        <h4>
            Mclaren in the future

        <p style="background-color: grey; border-color:darkorange; margin-left: 500px; margin-right: 500px; font-size: 200%; height: 500px;">
            After a string of poor results in 2022, Daniel Ricciardo (lower right) will be leaving McLaren at the end of the year. His replacement for 2023 and beyond is fellow Aussie Oscar Piastri, a 
            champion of many lower ranked racing series such as F2 and F3. Mclaren will certainly hope that the two youngsters of Norris and Piastri will bring a new era of success for the 
            team in the future!
